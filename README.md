# enhanced-eAFH (e2AFH)
This is a repository for an enhanced version of eAFH. The original version of eAFH is available in https://github.com/ds-kiel/eAFH. This repository has the following 3 parts:

## Part 1: Sample Heartrate (optional):
This folder contains the guide for installing Zephyr RTOS using command line tools both on Windows and Linux, and running a sample heartrate using a nRF52840 dongle as the peripheral and a nRF52840 development kit as the central. This part is not necessary for the other 2 parts.

## Part 2: The Original eAFH:
This folder contains the guide for installing the original eAFH using VS code. Implementing this part is necessary for implementing the enhanced eAFH unlike the part 1.

**NOTE**: This part containts a folder named "eAFH". This folder is exactly the same one available in the original eAFH page. It is attached to prevent any mismatch due to the possible future changes of the original eAFH.

## Part 3: The Enhanced eAFH:
This folder will contain the files and the guide for improving the original eAFH to the enhanced eAFH. It might be wrong before its official submission as an article.
