# enhanced-eAFH
This is a repository for an enhanced version of eAFH. The original version of eAFH is available in https://github.com/ds-kiel/eAFH. This repository has the following 3 parts:

## Step 1: Sample Heartrate:
This folder contains the guide for installing Zephyr RTOS using command line tools both on Windows and Linux, and running a sample heartrate using a nRF52840 dongle as the peripheral and a nRF52840 development kit as the central.

## Step 2: The Original eAFH:
This folder contains the guide for installing the original eAFH using 2 different methods. Doing this step is necessary for implementing the enhanced eAFH unlike the step 1.

## Step 3: The Enhanced eAFH:
This folder will contain the files and the guide for improving the original eAFH to the enhanced eAFH. It will be published after its official submission as an article.
